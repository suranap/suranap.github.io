I tried to run the [NVidia Nsight Compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-compute) profiler on [Perlmutter](https://docs.nersc.gov/). I used the following command in an sbatch script, which came from [NVidia Nsight Systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems). 

```
srun --output run_%t.log ncu --kernel-name ncclKernel_AllReduce_RING_LL_Sum_float --launch-skip 8 --launch-count 1 --target-processes all myprogram myargs ...
```

This failed to generate a profile. In the logs I found this message:
```
==ERROR== Profiling failed because a driver resource was unavailable. Ensure that no other tool (like DCGM) is concurrently collecting profiling data. See https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#faq for more details.
```

It turns out [Nvidia DCGM](https://developer.nvidia.com/dcgm) is running on Perlmutter nodes. So the trick is to run `dcgmi profile --pause` before executing the above `ncu` command. 

However, this still doesn't work for my use case. I'm trying to profile `ncclAllReduce` across 2 nodes. It starts profiling and then hangs for a very long time. So I'm back to trying random things to get unstuck.
